		<h2> RAM </h2>
		<span>Alternatively referred to as main memory, primary memory, or system memory, RAM (random-access memory) is a hardware device that allows information to be stored and retrieved on a computer. RAM is usually associated with DRAM, which is a type of memory module. Because data is accessed randomly instead of sequentially like it is on a CD or hard drive, access times are much faster. However, unlike ROM, RAM is a volatile memory and requires power to keep the data accessible. If the computer is turned off, all data contained in RAM is lost.</span>

The layout of different standards of RAM does vary, so, you can’t install DDR3 memory into a DDR4 slot.

There are a few factors you should consider before settling on what RAM to buy, most importantly – capacity, memory clock, and CAS Latency.

Currently, there’s no better value than a 16GB (2×8 GB) DDR4 3200 MHz CL16 Memory kit. You can find options from Corsair, Crucial, G.Skill, and a few others at attractive prices.

		<h2> Additional RAM information</h2>
		<span>As the computer boots, parts of the operating system and drivers are loaded into memory, which allows the CPU to process instructions faster and speed up the boot process.

If too many programs are open, the computer swaps the data in the memory between the RAM and the hard disk drive.</span>

		<span>A computer's performance is largely attributed to the amount of memory contained within it.

		<h2> History of RAM
</h2>
		<span>The first form of RAM came about in 1947 with the use of the Williams tube. It utilized a CRT (cathode ray tube); the data was stored on the face as electrically charged spots.</span>
<span>The second widely used form of RAM was magnetic-core memory, invented in 1947. Frederick Viehe is credited with much of the work, having filed for several patents relating to the design. Magnetic-core memory works through the use of tiny metal rings and wires connecting to each ring. One bit of data could be stored per ring and accessed at any time.</span>

<span>However, RAM, as we know it today, as solid-state memory, was first invented in 1968 by Robert Dennard. Known specifically as dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM, transistors were used to store bits of data.</span>

		<h2> Types of RAM </h2>
		<span>Over the evolution of the computer, there have been different variations of RAM. Some of the more common examples are DIMM, RIMM, SIMM, SO-DIMM, and SOO-RIMM. Below is an example image of a 512 MB DIMM computer memory module, a piece of RAM found in older desktop computers. This memory module would be installed into one of the memory slots on a motherboard.</span>
