		<h2> CPU </h2>
		<span> Alternately referred to as a processor, central processor, or microprocessor, the CPU (pronounced sea-pea-you) is the central processing unit of the computer. A computer's CPU handles all instructions it receives from hardware and software running on the computer.</span>

		<h2> CPU overview</h2>
		<span>The picture below is an example of what the bottom and top of an AMD RYZEN processor may look. The processor is placed and secured into a compatible CPU socket found on the motherboard. Processors produce heat, so they are covered with a heat sink to keep them cool and running smoothly. To help transfer the heat between the CPU and the heat sink</span>

	<span>As seen in the picture above, the CPU chip is usually square with one notched corner to help make sure it's properly inserted into the CPU socket. On the bottom of the chip are hundreds of connector pins that correspond to the socket holes. Today, most CPU's resemble the picture shown above. However, Intel and AMD have also experimented with slot processors. They were much larger and slid into a slot on the motherboard. Also, over the years, there were several types of sockets on motherboards. Each socket only supports specific types of processors and each has its own pin layout.</span>

		<h2> CPU history</h2>
		<span>The CPU was first developed at Intel with the help of Ted Hoff and others in the early 1970s. The first processor released by Intel was the 4004 processor, shown in the picture.</span>

		<h2> Could a computer work without a CPU? </h2>
		<span>No. All computers require some type of CPU.
