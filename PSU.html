                <p>All the components in your system need a reliable, steady supply of power. <em>A Power Supply Unit () does just
                        that!</em></p>
                <p>They come in <strong>modular</strong>, <strong>semi-modular</strong>, and <strong>regular variants</strong>. If
                    you’re pretty nitpicky about cable management and would rather avoid any unused cables, pick a modular or
                    semi-modular PSU. They’ll ensure that you use only the wires that your system needs.</p>

                    <div class="PSUP"> </div>

                    <p>A widespread mistake is compromising on the quality of a power supply to focus your budget on other aspects of the
                        system. Don’t do this. A cheap power supply can even cause permanent damage to your components.</p>
                    <p>We recommend shopping for a 500W 80-Plus Bronze Rated PSU at the very least. Use this <a

            As you can see, unless you’re running a very power-hungry system, the power savings at each tier will be minimal. For
            most users, an 80 Plus Bronze PSU is the sweet spot between quality and price. If you do want to spend a bit more, We
            recommend a<strong> jump to gold and above</strong>.
            <p>
                Don’t bother with silver unless you’re getting a fantastic deal on one.
            </p>
            <p>
            Now that you have most of your components installed, you need to give them power. If you have a modular power supply,
            then you can use the cables that you need, if not then you will need to do some cable management (stuffing) later on.
            </p>
            <p>
            If your case has a separate enclosure for your PSU, you’ll have to install it from the back of the case. If not, you
            can do it from the front.
        </p>
            <p>
            Just slide the PSU into place and make sure the side with the D/C Power faces the right direction (towards the
            back/outside of the case, the same direction as the I/O ports of your motherboard). Also, the fan-side of the PSU
            should usually face where there is a grill in the Case, so it doesn&#8217;t suffocate when pulling Air in.

            Screw the PSU into place with the included screws. Now that the PSU is in its place, all you need to do is plug in
            the different components.

            <p>
                Here&#8217;s a graphic that shows what cables are plugged in where on the PSU and other Components:

            <p>
                And here is a quick look at how I routed the cables through the case. The CPU Power comes up top from behind and the
                ATX Power comes from the back through the middle Part of the Case to be plugged into its corresponding 24-Pin Plug
                on the Motherboard.
