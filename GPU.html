      <p>
        A graphics card (GPU) typically handles and generates a feed that outputs to a monitor.      
      If you’re only consuming media and browsing the web, you don’t need a powerful GPU. However, if you’re gaming, <b> editing
      videos, designing 3D art </b>, or generating complex scenes, and want the best experience, you should consider allocating a
      good chunk of your budget to this component.
    </p>
      <p>
        The options listed above are great for most users. However, if you’re planning to play games at high resolutions or set
        up a workstation for professional work, you should <b>consider consulting benchmarks charts and vary your budget
        accordingly.</b>
      </p>
      <br>
       <p>
          Next up is the Graphics Card. Its purpose is the processing of anything that has to do with
        <strong><em>visuals</em> and outputs these visuals (Images, User Interface, GUI) onto the Monitor</strong>.
        There are two main types of GPUs, the integrated GPU (iGPU) and a discrete GPU.
        <strong>The integrated GPU is integrated into the CPU</strong>. This means, some CPUs already have a graphics chip
        built-in and you will not need an additional GPU to attach a monitor to.
        When your CPU has an integrated Graphics chip (such as the Intel i9 10900K CPU) <strong>you can connect your monitor to the display Adapter on the Motherboard</strong>. The thing with integrated GPUs though is: Their performance is very limited.
        They are usually good enough for light tasks such as Word-Processing and some minor Games but as soon as you want to
        dive into graphics-heavy tasks such as <strong>3D GPU Rendering</strong>,
        High-End Gaming, <strong>Video Editing</strong>, <strong>Graphic Design,</strong> and many others,<strong>you will have to get yourself a discrete GPU</strong>.
      </p>
        <p>
        A discrete GPU is a GPU that is not part of the CPU. It comes on its own printed circuit board (like the one in
        the
        picture above), that is then <strong>plugged into a PCI Express Slot on your Motherboard</strong>.
        Some modern GPUs include Nvidia&#8217;s RTX generation such as the <strong>RTX 3060 Ti</strong>, <strong>RTX
          3070</strong>, <strong>RTX 3080</strong>. 
        The competitor AMD also has a solid line-up with the <strong>AMD Radeon RX 6800</strong> or
        <strong>6800XT</strong>. 
        The two Manufacturers, Nvidia and AMD are fighting a fierce battle in getting a lead over the other, but at the
        moment it seems as though <strong>NVIDIA would be the Brand to pick</strong> over AMD if you are looking <strong>
	for the maximum performance</strong> you can get out of a GPU.

        Now that we have everything in place, we can install the graphics card. Most graphics cards have a
      <strong>dual-slot
        design</strong>, and you need to <strong>remove two slots openings</strong> at the back of the case for every
      graphics card you want to install. 
      Free up space directly behind the PCI-E slot and one below it by unscrewing the screws holding the <em>slot cover</em> in place. 
      Push down the latch of the PCI-E slot you want to use for your graphics card. This is similar to the latch on
      the RAM slots. Ideally, it would be best to use the very first PCI-E slot on your motherboard (first from the
      motherboard’s I/O ports). 
      <em>Please note</em> – some motherboards won’t have a push-latch (at the back of the slot). It’ll slot into place
      without pushing anything. However, you’ll need to apply downward pressure to a small lever at the back of the slot
      to get your graphics card <em><strong>out</strong></em>. 
      Align your graphics card with the PCI-E slot and gently push it in – you should hear a click. This tells you that the
      card is secure in its slot. Once done, secure the graphics card to the case using the screws you removed in the previous step. 
      Give your graphics card power, if needed using the PCI-E power cable from your power supply. If you have a powerful
      GPU, you’ll need two of these connectors for extra power. These cables will be labeled, so look for ones that say ‘PCI-E.’ 
      However, many entry-level cards won’t need this power connector and can draw sufficient power from the slot
      itself.
