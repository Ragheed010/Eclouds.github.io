        Graphics Card (GPU)
      </h2>
      <span>
        Next up is the Graphics Card. Its purpose is the processing of anything that has to do with
        <strong><em>visuals</em>
          and outputs these visuals (Images, User Interface, GUI) onto the Monitor</strong>.
      </span> <br>
      <span>
        There are two main types of GPUs, the integrated GPU (iGPU) and a discrete GPU.
      </span><br>
      <span>
        <strong>The integrated GPU is integrated into the CPU</strong>. This means, some CPUs already have a graphics
        chip
        built-in and you will not need an additional GPU to attach a monitor to.
      </span><br>
      <span>
        When your CPU has an integrated Graphics chip (such as the Intel i9 10900K CPU) <strong>you can connect your
          monitor
          to the display Adapter on the Motherboard</strong>. The thing with integrated GPUs though is: Their
        performance
        is
        very limited.
      </span><br>
      <span>
        They are usually good enough for light tasks such as Word-Processing and some minor Games but as soon as you
        want
        to
        dive into graphics-heavy tasks such as <strong>3D GPU Rendering</strong>,
        High-End Gaming, <strong>Video Editing</strong>, <strong>Graphic Design,</strong> and many others,
        <strong>you
          will have to get yourself a discrete GPU</strong>.
      </span><br>

      <span>
        A discrete GPU is a GPU that is not part of the CPU. It comes on its own printed circuit board (like the one in
        the
        picture above), that is then <strong>plugged into a PCI Express Slot on your Motherboard</strong>.
      </span><br>
      <span>
        Some modern GPUs include Nvidia&#8217;s RTX generation such as the <strong>RTX 3060 Ti</strong>, <strong>RTX
          3070</strong>, <strong>RTX 3080</strong>.
      </span><br>
      <span>
        The competitor AMD also has a solid line-up with the <strong>AMD Radeon RX 6800</strong> or
        <strong>6800XT</strong>.
      </span><br>
      <span>
        The two Manufacturers, Nvidia and AMD are fighting a fierce battle in getting a lead over the other, but at the
        moment it seems as though <strong>NVIDIA would be the Brand to pick</strong> over AMD if you are looking
        <strong>for
          the maximum performance</strong> you can get out of a GPU.

          <hover> Now that we have everything in place, we can install the graphics card.</hover> Most graphics cards have a
          <strong>dual-slot
            design</strong>, and you need to <strong>remove two slots openings</strong> at the back of the case for
          every
          graphics card you want to install.
        </span><br>
        <span>
          Free up space directly behind the PCI-E slot and one below it by unscrewing the screws holding the <em>slot
            cover</em> in place.
        </span><br>
        <span>
          Push down the latch of the PCI-E slot you want to use for your graphics card. This is similar to the latch on
          the RAM
          slots. Ideally, it would be best to use the very first PCI-E slot on your motherboard (first from the
          motherboard’s
          I/O ports).
        </span><br>
        <span>
          <em>Please note</em> – some motherboards won’t have a push-latch (at the back of the slot). It’ll slot into
          place
          without pushing anything. However, you’ll need to apply downward pressure to a small lever at the back of the
          slot
          to get your graphics card <em><strong>out</strong></em>.
        </span><br>
        <span>
          Align your graphics card with the PCI-E slot and gently push it in – you should hear a click. This tells you
          that the
          card is secure in its slot. Once done, secure the graphics card to the case using the screws you removed in
          the
          previous step.
        </span><br>
        <span>
          Give your graphics card power, if needed using the PCI-E power cable from your power supply. If you have a
          powerful
          GPU, you’ll need two of these connectors for extra power. These cables will be labeled, so look for ones that
          say
          ‘PCI-E.’
        </span><br>
        <span>
          However, many entry-level cards won’t need this power connector and can draw sufficient power from the slot
          itself.
