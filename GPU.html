        A graphics card (GPU) typically handles and generates a feed that outputs to a monitor.      
      If you’re only consuming media and browsing the web, you don’t need a powerful GPU. However, if you’re gaming, <b> editing
      videos, designing 3D art </b>, or generating complex scenes, and want the best experience, you should consider allocating a
      good chunk of your budget to this component.
    </p>

        The options listed above are great for most users. However, if you’re planning to play games at high resolutions or set
        up a workstation for professional work, you should <b>consider consulting benchmarks charts and vary your budget
        accordingly.</b>

          Next up is the Graphics Card. Its purpose is the processing of anything that has to do with
        <strong><em>visuals</em> and outputs these visuals (Images, User Interface, GUI) onto the Monitor</strong>.
        There are two main types of GPUs, the integrated GPU (iGPU) and a discrete GPU.
        <strong>The integrated GPU is integrated into the CPU</strong>. This means, some CPUs already have a graphics chip
        built-in and you will not need an additional GPU to attach a monitor to.
        When your CPU has an integrated Graphics chip (such as the Intel i9 10900K CPU) <strong>you can connect your monitor to the display Adapter on the Motherboard</strong>. The thing with integrated GPUs though is: Their performance is very limited.
        They are usually good enough for light tasks such as Word-Processing and some minor Games but as soon as you want to
        dive into graphics-heavy tasks such as <strong>3D GPU Rendering</strong>,
        High-End Gaming, <strong>Video Editing</strong>, <strong>Graphic Design,</strong> and many others,<strong>you will have to get yourself a discrete GPU</strong>.
      </p>
        <p>
        A discrete GPU is a GPU that is not part of the CPU. It comes on its own printed circuit board (like the one in
        the
        picture above), that is then <strong>plugged into a PCI Express Slot on your Motherboard</strong>.
        Some modern GPUs include Nvidia&#8217;s RTX generation such as the <strong>RTX 3060 Ti</strong>, <strong>RTX
          3070</strong>, <strong>RTX 3080</strong>. 
        The competitor AMD also has a solid line-up with the <strong>AMD Radeon RX 6800</strong> or
        <strong>6800XT</strong>. 
        The two Manufacturers, Nvidia and AMD are fighting a fierce battle in getting a lead over the other, but at the
        moment it seems as though <strong>NVIDIA would be the Brand to pick</strong> over AMD if you are looking <strong>
	for the maximum performance</strong> you can get out of a GPU.
