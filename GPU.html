    <h2> 
      Graphics Card (GPU)
          </h2>
    <p>
      Next up is the Graphics Card. Its purpose is the processing of anything that has to do with
      <strong><em>visuals</em>
        and outputs these visuals (Images, User Interface, GUI) onto the Monitor</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two main types of GPUs, the integrated GPU (iGPU) and a discrete GPU.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The integrated GPU is integrated into the CPU</strong>. This means, some CPUs already have a graphics chip
      built-in and you will not need an additional GPU to attach a monitor to.
    </p>
    <p>
      When your CPU has an integrated Graphics chip (such as the Intel i9 10900K CPU) <strong>you can connect your
        monitor
        to the display Adapter on the Motherboard</strong>. The thing with integrated GPUs though is: Their performance
      is
      very limited.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are usually good enough for light tasks such as Word-Processing and some minor Games but as soon as you want
      to
      dive into graphics-heavy tasks such as <strong>3D GPU Rendering</strong>,
      High-End Gaming, <strong>Video Editing</strong>, <strong>Graphic Design,</strong> and many others,
      <strong>you
        will have to get yourself a discrete GPU</strong>.

    <p>
      A discrete GPU is a GPU that is not part of the CPU. It comes on its own printed circuit board (like the one in
      the
      picture above), that is then <strong>plugged into a PCI Express Slot on your Motherboard</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some modern GPUs include Nvidia&#8217;s RTX generation such as the <strong>RTX 3060 Ti</strong>, <strong>RTX 3070</strong>, <strong>RTX 3080</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The competitor AMD also has a solid line-up with the <strong>AMD Radeon RX 6800</strong> or <strong>6800XT</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two Manufacturers, Nvidia and AMD are fighting a fierce battle in getting a lead over the other, but at the
      moment it seems as though <strong>NVIDIA would be the Brand to pick</strong> over AMD if you are looking
      <strong>for
        the maximum performance</strong> you can get out of a GPU.

<h3> Graphics Card </h3>

<p>Now that we have everything in place, we can install the graphics card. Most graphics cards have a <strong>dual-slot
    design</strong>, and you need to <strong>remove two slots openings</strong> at the back of the case for every
  graphics card you want to install.</p>
<p>Free up space directly behind the PCI-E slot and one below it by unscrewing the screws holding the <em>slot
    cover</em> in place.</p>
<p>Push down the latch of the PCI-E slot you want to use for your graphics card. This is similar to the latch on the RAM
  slots. Ideally, it would be best to use the very first PCI-E slot on your motherboard (first from the motherboard’s
  I/O ports).</p>
<p><em>Please note</em> – some motherboards won’t have a push-latch (at the back of the slot). It’ll slot into place
  without pushing anything. However, you’ll need to apply downward pressure to a small lever at the back of the slot
  to get your graphics card <em><strong>out</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Align your graphics card with the PCI-E slot and gently push it in – you should hear a click. This tells you that the
  card is secure in its slot. Once done, secure the graphics card to the case using the screws you removed in the
  previous step.</p>
<p>Give your graphics card power, if needed using the PCI-E power cable from your power supply. If you have a powerful
  GPU, you’ll need two of these connectors for extra power. These cables will be labeled, so look for ones that say
  ‘PCI-E.’</p>
<p>However, many entry-level cards won’t need this power connector and can draw sufficient power from the slot itself.

<p>That&#8217;s it for internal PC-Parts, let&#8217;s close the Case back up:</p>
