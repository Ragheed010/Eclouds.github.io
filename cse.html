Welcome to Computer Science & Engineering, your information resource on anything related to Computer Science & Engineering.
<br>
<br> Computer Science Engineering (CSE) encompasses a variety of topics that relates to computation,
like analysis of algorithms, programming languages, program design, software, and computer hardware.
Computer Science engineering has roots in electrical engineering, mathematics, and linguistics.
In the past Computer Science was taught as part of mathematics or engineering departments & in the recent days it has emerged as a separate engineering field.
What does a Computer Science Engineer do?
Design and develop software application for different industries
Manages the software, hardware & networks in any industry
Involves in the design and development of the hardware components of PCs & laptops
Develop software for peripheral computing devices such as printers, modems and scanners
Writes code and algorithms for operating systems like Windows, Linux etc.
