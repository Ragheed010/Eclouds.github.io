		<h2> Computer case
 </h2>
		<span>Cases are available in different sizes. They’re named to indicate the motherboard form factors they support. For example, an ATX case can house an ATX, or smaller, motherboard easily.

So, you can use an ATX case with a Mini-ITX motherboard, but a Mini-ITX cabinet isn’t compatible with an ATX motherboard.

If you’re building a robust system that’ll generate loads of heat, airflow becomes paramount. However, most modern cases have good airflow, so you don’t need to worry too much in this regard.

A front-mesh style cabinet does offer the best air intake.

</span>

</div>

<div id="extra" class="container">
		<h2> Layout </h2>
		<span>Nonetheless, base your choice on your preference more than anything else.

Although an ATX cabinet will be compatible with most of your components, make sure you check graphics card length and CPU cooler clearance. In case you’re using a third-party CPU cooler (and not the one included with your processor, if any), you have to make sure it’ll fit into your case.

Aesthetics play a significant role when getting a PC case. The case is not something that you’ll change a year or two down the line.

It’s a long-term commitment. So, choose wisely!</span>

<h2>Appearance</h2>
		<span>ase modding is the artistic styling of computer cases, often to draw attention to the use of advanced or unusual components. Since the early 2000s, some cases have included clear side panels or acrylic windows so that users can look inside while it is operating. Modded cases may also include colored internal lighting, custom paint, or liquid cooling systems. Some hobbyists build custom cases from raw materials like aluminum, steel, styrofoam, acrylic, or wood.

		<h2> Major component locations </h2>
		<span>The motherboard is usually screwed to the case along its largest face, which could be the bottom or the side of the case depending on the 


		form factor and orientation.
Form factors such as ATX provide a back panel with cut-out holes to expose I/O ports provided by integrated peripherals, as well as expansion slots which may optionally expose additional ports provided by expansion cards. Many larger ATX cases can also be used with motherboards of other form factors.


The power supply unit mounting point differs from case to case, but the most commonly used locations (both at the rear of the case) and their benefits/disadvantages </span>

		<h2> History of RAM
</h2>
		<span>The first form of RAM came about in 1947 with the use of the Williams tube. It utilized a CRT (cathode ray tube); the data was stored on the face as electrically charged spots.</span>
<span>The second widely used form of RAM was magnetic-core memory, invented in 1947. Frederick Viehe is credited with much of the work, having filed for several patents relating to the design. Magnetic-core memory works through the use of tiny metal rings and wires connecting to each ring. One bit of data could be stored per ring and accessed at any time.</span>

<span>However, RAM, as we know it today, as solid-state memory, was first invented in 1968 by Robert Dennard. Known specifically as dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM, transistors were used to store bits of data.</span>
