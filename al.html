<br> What is applied linguistics? What do applied linguists do?
Though the term "applied linguistics" has traditionally been associated with the scientific study of such areas as
TESOL, TEFL, TESL, language teaching and learning, applied linguists do a variety of things:
The basic idea is, as the definition implies, to contribute to the real-world issues.
Some of the questions that applied linguists ask include:
-How can languages best be learnt and taught?
-What social factors affect language learning?
-How can technology be used to contribute to the effectiveness of language teaching/learning?
-What are the related problems associated with language disorders? How can these be prevented?
