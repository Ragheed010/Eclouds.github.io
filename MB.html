		<h2> CPU and Motherboards: Picking the Right Combination </h2>

		<span> When it comes to desktop CPUs, there are two brands that you can choose from – AMD and Intel. This choice dictates what motherboard you can and cannot pick.</span>

</div>



<div id="extra" class="container">
		<h2> Motherboard Form Factors</h2>
		<span>Before picking motherboards, it’s important to understand the various sizes out there.<b>Not every motherboard will fit into every case.</b></span>

		<span>Some people prefer compact systems, while others like large ones. You can pick from a variety of motherboard form factors to suit your PC cabinet and personal preferences.</span>


<span>Intel developed the ATX specification in 1995 to standardize board design and improve on older implementations.</span>

ATX (Advanced Technology eXtended) – One of the most popular form factors. It offers a fairly standard layout and usually features 4 DIMM (memory/RAM) slots along with multiple full-length (x8/x16) PCI-E slots.
E-ATX (Extended ATX) – One of the largest form factors available for mainstream use. It typically offers the most features and extensibility – giving you flexibility with regards to peripherals. These motherboards should come with 3 or more full-length PCI-E slots.
M-ATX (Micro ATX) – A compact implementation of the ATX standard. It usually features 2 or 4-DIMM configurations for memory and very rarely features more than 2 full-length PCI-E slots. It’s an excellent choice for those wanting a reasonably compact build.
M-ITX (Mini ITX) – One of the most compact form factors widely available for mainstream computers. Although they have limited extensibility due to their diminutive size, they have no peer when it comes to building extremely compact PCs.
