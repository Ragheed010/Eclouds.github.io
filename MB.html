		<h2> Motherboard </h2>
		<span>Alternatively referred to as the mb, mainboard, mboard, mobo, mobd, backplane board, base board, main circuit board, planar board, system board, or a logic board on Apple computers. The motherboard is a printed circuit board and foundation of a computer that is the biggest board in a computer chassis. It allocates power and allows communication to and between the CPU, RAM, and all other computer hardware components.</span>

<div id="extra" class="container">
		<h2> Motherboard  overview</h2>
		<span>A motherboard provides connectivity between the hardware components of a computer, like the processor (CPU), memory (RAM), hard drive, and video card. There are multiple types of motherboards, designed to fit different types and sizes of computers.</span>

		<span>Each type of motherboard is designed to work with specific types of processors and memory, so they don't work with every processor and type of memory. However, hard drives are mostly universal and work with the majority of motherboards, regardless of the type or brand.</span>

<span>Below is a picture of the ASUS P5AD2-E motherboard with labels next to each of its major components. Clicking the image directs you to a larger and more detailed version.</span>

		<h2> How does a motherboard connect to a computer case?
</h2>
		<span>A computer motherboard connects to a desktop computer case using standouts. Once the motherboard is attached to the case, all other devices connect to the motherboard itself or an expansion card.</span>

</div>



<div id="extra" class="container">
		<h2> Is there a motherboard in a laptop, smartphone, and tablet?
 </h2>
		<span>Yes, although the board is often referred to as a "logic board" and not a motherboard. The logic board is very similar to a motherboard and operates the same way. However, because of size requirements with most logic boards, components like the processor and RAM (in tablets and smartphones) are soldered onto the board. Also, because many of these devices have no upgrade options, there are no slots or sockets like a traditional computer motherboard.
